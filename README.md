# I <3 Documentation

Hello Internet stranger! Welcome to the documentation celebration party! Documentation is awesome but too commonly underappreciated so we are having a party for documentation and for those who take the time to write documentation!!!

> **Documentation is about showing your work** so that others can understand and replicate it.
>
> **Documentation is accessible**. Share it with others!
>
> **Documentation is never complete** — it's better to ship it even it you don't feel ready. Also, it can grow and change as others react to it.
>
> **Documentation is honest.** It's OK to note where you're not confident your documentation is correct. It's also important to record which parts of the project were difficult.

## Examples of documentation

* Setting up a new development environment *and sharing all the steps you took*
* Hacking on a side project *and explaining how to replicate it step-by-step*
* Facing a new challenge *and writing an article or blog post about how you overcame it*
* Konmari’ng your home *and vlogging the process*
* Creating a painting *and showing the concept sketches leading up to the final painting*
* Building an experimental at-home method of growing a liver *and writing up how you did it with pictures*
* Sourcing a new printer for your artwork* and writing a post explaining how to evaluate and establish a relationship*
* Doing science *and sharing your lab notebook*

## Benefits

Here are all the reasons documentation is awesome so you can tell your friends and invite them to the documentation writing brigade!

* For the individual
    * **Scale yourself & save time:** Documentation is scalable! Instead of 3 random people seeing your work and asking three individual questions, you write the documentation once and save time.
    * **Find mistakes (debug)** Helps you catch errors you may have missed and trace the cause 
    * **Solidify your own knowledge:** Reflection is an opportunity to solidify your own understanding and find ways to innovate. 
    * **Bonus tip for people in machine learning!** Machine learning is like science where keeping a lab notebook will help you keep track of your experiments
    * **Notes for yourself!** You have instructions for yourself if you forget esp after a vacation :)
    * **Make friends!** Find your community even if it’s just one other person! :) 
* For the individual (longterm)
    * **Practice essential skills:** If your hope is to grow your influence over the course of your career, good writing skills are essential and documentation is a good opportunity to do this
    * **Build your brand**
    * **Personal satisfaction:** Look back in years and see how much you’ve grown
* For the community
    * **Strengthen the community:** Talks and communication are the backbone of a technical community
    * **Community Growth:** Encouraging more documentation grows the community → you present more material and you might hit more audiences
    * **Immortalize the knowledge:** It’s sad to say, but not everyone will be around forever and it’d suck to have knowledge locked up in people’s heads
    * Helps you create a more global community
* Save the world
    * **Break the silos:** By making more diverse introductory material available, you promote collaboration between different technical systems
    * **Fight Imposter syndrome**
    * **Diversity! Representation!** Encouraging more documentation grows the community → you present more material and you might hit more audiences. There are lots of cosplayers and lots of ML people, but not many ML cosplayers. 
* Fun
    * Leads to surprises because you don’t know who is interested

## FAQs
